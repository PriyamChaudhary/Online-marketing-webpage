                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Nisch</h2>
                <p class="center">Niche affiliate marketing is an affiliate marketing strategy in which the marketer focuses his or her efforts on a certain niche, or category.
                     As with overall affiliate marketing, this strategy focuses on placing affiliate ads on a relevant website and obtaining traffic to find potential buyers. Most affiliate marketers participate in niche affiliate marketing. Before jumping into a niche,
                     experienced marketers will check search engines for competition and ensure there is traffic for the niche.</p>

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Bulk Ordering</h2>
                <p class="center">The affiliate gets a unique link (an "affiliate link") from which clicks can be tracked — typically using cookies.
                    The cookie then tracks the user to see if they make a purchase. 
                    If they do within an allotted amount of time, then the affiliate will earn commission.
                    Each cookie has a "length" or "cookie life", which simply defines how long the cookie will be tracking the user's online activity.
                    For example, if a cookie has a 30-day life, your referral needs to make a purchase within 30-days of clicking your affiliate link in order for you to get paid — otherwise the lead will no longer be trackable.
                    If you’re interested in starting an affiliate program, there are different types of affiliate programs, 
                    and you'll want to pick the one best-suited for your business. Let's dive into the types of affiliate programs,next</p>

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Email Marketing</h2>
                <p class="center">This is best in small doses.You don't want to send out bulk emails to an audience who isn’t interested in promoted products or services. 
                However, with proper consideration for who's receiving the email, this could be an effective method.
                For instance, if you work for a marketing agency, you could partner with a company that sells design tools and include an affiliate within emails you send to design clients.
                This could help your clients create higher-quality content while providing an added source of revenue.</p>
